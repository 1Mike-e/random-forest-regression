# Random Forest Regression

This project demonstrates how to use **Random Forest Regression** to predict salaries based on position levels. It uses a dataset containing position titles and corresponding salaries, and applies a machine learning model from the `scikit-learn` library to predict salaries for new position levels.

## 📁 Files

- `random_forest_regression.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing code for data loading, model training, prediction, and visualization.
- `Position_Salaries.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset with position levels and corresponding salaries.

## 📦 Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
